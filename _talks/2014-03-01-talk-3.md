For my English 300 class, I was required to perform a small project pretending that I was in my future career and then at the end of the semester, present a small portion of the project to the class. I was working on an exoplanet research project at the time, so I had some background knowledge about exoplanets, but not so much about astrobiology side of things, so I decided to do this project over the possibility of life on exoplanets. For my project, I decided to take the approach of presenting a research project to a group of people to where even if they knew very little about exoplanets or knows quite a bit, that anyone can follow along. About a week before the due date, I invited the WKU Physics and Astronomy students and my exoplanet research adviser to watch my presentation and ask any questions or give tips. My presentation to my department went well and it turned out exactly as I had hoped for as some students that knew nothing about astronomy to even my research advisor told me that they enjoyed the presentation and that they learned something from it. I then took a small portion of my full presentation and presented that to my english class and I ended up being voted as best presentation.
